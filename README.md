# React_Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio using react and tailwind. This portfolio is where i will be displaying my skills from previous projects to employers. This will be update frequently to show off some of my personal favorite projects.

# Inspiration

I wanted to create a professional portfolio that i can show to employers. I specifically wanted to create this using React.js so that i can showcase some of my react skills to people that visit my site.

Currently, I am updating the projects section of my portfolio that showcases some of my favorite passion projects. Eventually, i would like to upgrade this portfolio once i discover some new tricks to improve my react skills.
